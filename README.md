# What is blockchain

Decentralized Applications (or DApps) are applications that do not rely on a centralized backend running in AWS or Azure
that power traditional web and mobile applications (outside of hosting the frontend code itself). Instead, the 
application interacts directly with a blockchain which can be thought of distributed cluster of nodes analogous to 
applications interacting directly with a “masterless” cluster of Cassandra nodes with full replication on every peer 
in an untrusted peer-to-peer network.

# Tezos
## Secure, Institutional Grade Smart Contracts
Tezos is designed to provide the safety and code correctness required for assets and other high value use cases. 
Its native smart contract language, Michelson, facilitates formal verification, a methodology commonly used in 
mission-critical environments such as the aerospace, nuclear, and semiconductor industries.

# Smartpy
The SmartPy language is available through a Python library for building and analyzing Tezos smart contracts.
